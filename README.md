## Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/khaykingleb/ASR.git
cd ASR
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```

Or just open in Google Colab notebook:

## Data Used

* Мозиловский датасет сначала
* LJ Speech [https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/](https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/)
* Librispeech

## Recommended implementation order

You might be a little intimidated by the number of folders and classes. Try to follow this steps to gradually undestand
the workflow.

1) Test `hw_asr/tests/test_dataset.py`  and `hw_asr/tests/test_config.py` and make sure everythin works for you
2) Implement missing functions to fix tests in  `hw_asr\tests\test_text_encoder.py`
3) Implement missing functions to fix tests in  `hw_asr\tests\test_dataloader.py`
4) Implement functions in `hw_asr\metric\utils.py`
5) Implement missing function to run `train.py` with a baseline model
6) Write your own model and try to overfit it on a single batch
7) ~~Pain and suffering~~ Implement your own models and train them. You've mastered this template when you can tune your
   experimental setup just by tuning `configs.json` file and running `train.py`
8) Don't forget to write a report about your work
9) Get hired by Google the next day

## Before submitting

0) Make sure your projects run on a new machine after complemeting installation guide
1) Search project for `# TODO: your code here` and implement missing functionality
2) Make sure all tests work without errors
   ```shell
   python -m unittest discover hw_asr/tests
   ```
3) Make sure `test.py` works fine and works as expected. You should create files `default_test_config.json` and your
   installation guide should download your model checpoint and configs in `default_test_model/checkpoint.pth`
   and `default_test_model/config.json`.
   ```shell
   python test.py \
      -c default_test_config.json \
      -r default_test_model/checkpoint.pth \
      -t test_data \
      -o test_result.json
   ```
4) Use `train.py` for training

## Credits

this repository is based on a heavily modified fork
of [pytorch-template](https://github.com/victoresque/pytorch-template) repository.

## TODO

These barebones can use more tests. We highly encourage students to create pull requests to add more tests / new
functionality. Current demands:

* Tests for beam search
* W&B logger backend
* README section to describe folders
* Notebook to show how to work with `ConfigParser` and `config_parser.init_obj(...)`
